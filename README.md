# Littorina_SeqDat_pipeline
Littorina sequence data pipeline planning

This GitHub page is designed for us to share code and small text files that we use for designing a sequence data variant calling pipeline.
Currently this page is private. I plan to make it public once we have settled on a basic pipeline for our analyses.
