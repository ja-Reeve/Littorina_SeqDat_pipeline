This is a protocol for a standard pipeline for processing short-read seqeuncing data from *Littorina* snails. Each step was carefully considered to get the best results from short reads of a non-model species. The detailed desceription of this pipeline is published [here](https://www.protocols.io/view/a-standard-pipeline-for-processing-short-read-sequ-c6ygzftw).
